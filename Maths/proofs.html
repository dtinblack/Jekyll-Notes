<h1 style="text-align: left">Euclid's proof of the infinity of primes:</h1>

<p>

Assume that the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a> is finite. Make a list of al of the priem numbers \(p_1, p_2, p_3 ..., p_n\).Let \(P\) be the products of all of the primes in the list, \(P = p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 \times ... \times p_n \)
Let number \(q = P + 1 \). The number is either prime or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number">composite</a>. <br><br>

If q is prime, we have found a prime that is not in the list, which is a contradiction that the set contains all of the primes. <br><br>

If q is composite  then by the unisqu factorization theroem it must be divisible  by some prime not in the list.  <br><br>

Either way, there will always be primes not included in any list, regardless of size. Therefore there must be infinitley many prime numbers.
