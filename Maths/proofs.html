"From a logical point of view, there is no difference between a lemma, proposition, theorem, or corollary - they are all claims waiting to be proved. However, we use these terms to suggest different levels of importance and difficulty.<br><br>

A <b>lemma</b> is an easily proved claim which is helpful for proving other propositions and theorems, but is usually not particularly interesting in its own right.<br><br>

A <b>proposition</b> is a statement which is interesting in its own right, while<br><br>

a <b>theorem</b> is a more important statement than a proposition which says something definitive on the subject, and often takes more effort to prove than a proposition or lemma. <br><br>

A <b>corollary</b> is a quick consequence of a proposition or theorem that was proven recently."<br><br>

Starting with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">Natural Numbers</a> as the basis of what follows i.e. \(\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, \infty\}\). <br><br>

<h1 style="text-align: left">Definition: Even Number</h1>
<p>
Any natural number that can be exactly divided by \(2\) i.e. no reminder.
An even number takes the form \(n = 2 k\) where \(k \in \mathbb{N} \).
</p>


<h1 style="text-align: left">Definition: Odd Number</h1>
<p>
Any natural number that <i>cannot</i> be divided exactly by \(2\). An odd number has the form \(n = 2 k + 1\) where \(k \in \mathbb{N} \).
</p>


<h1 style="text-align: left">Definition: Prime Number</h1>
<p>
A number \(p\) is prime if:<br>

(i)  \(p \gt 1\) <br>
(ii) \(p\) has no positive divisor except \(1\) and \(p\).<br>

<h1 style="text-align: left">Euclid's proof of the infinity of primes:</h1>

<p>

Assume that the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime numbers</a> is finite. Make a list of al of the priem numbers \(p_1, p_2, p_3 ..., p_n\).Let \(P\) be the products of all of the primes in the list, \(P = p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 \times ... \times p_n \)
Let number \(q = P + 1 \). The number is either prime or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number">composite</a>. <br><br>

If q is prime, we have found a prime that is not in the list, which is a contradiction that the set contains all of the primes. <br><br>

If q is composite  then by the unisqu factorization theroem it must be divisible  by some prime not in the list.  <br><br>

Either way, there will always be primes not included in any list, regardless of size. Therefore there must be infinitley many prime numbers.
