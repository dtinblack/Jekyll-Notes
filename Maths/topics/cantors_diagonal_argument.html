The <b>Power Set</b> of a set \(S \) is the set of all subsets of \(S\) including the empty set
and \(S\) itself. For example, if the set \( S = \{a, b, c\} \) then \(\mathcal{P}(S) = \{ \{ \}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\},
\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b.c\} \} \).

<br>
<br>
The size of, or cardinality, of the power set shown in the example is \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 8 = 2^3 \). In general for a finite set of size \(n\) then the size of the power set will
be: \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2 ^ n \).
<br>
<br>
A property of a power set is that the elements of a set can be put into a one-to-one relationship with the elements of
its power set, for example:
<br>
<br>
\( f(a) = \{ \} \)
<br>
<br>
\( f(b) = \{b,c\} \)
<br>
<br>
\( f(c) = \{ a \} \)
<br>
<br>
then \( a \notin \{ \} \), \( b \in \{b,c\} \) and \( c \notin \{ a \} \). this property will be used in
proving Cantor's Power Set theorem.

<b>Cantor's Power Set Theorem</b> states that the cardinality of a power set is always greater than the
cardinality of the set i.e. \( |\mathcal{P}(S)| > |S|  \)
