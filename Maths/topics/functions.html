A function, \(f\), from set \(A\) to set \(B\), is a rule that assigns each element of  \(A\) to exactly one element
of  \(B\), and we write \(f ( a ) = b \) and say that \(f\) maps \(a\) to \(b\). To indicate
that \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\) we write: \(f: A \rightarrow B \). The set \(A\) is called the <i>domain</i> and
set \(B\) is called the <i>codomain</i>.

<b>Definitions:</b>
<br><br>

1. \(f\) is <b>one-to-one</b> or <b>injective</b> if <i>preimages</i> are unique. In this case, \( ( a \neq b ) \rightarrow ( f(a) \neq f(b) ) \)

<br><br>

2. \(f\) is <b>onto</b> or <b>surjective</b> if every \(y \in B \) has a preimage. In this case, the range of the (\f\) is equal to the codomain.

<br><br>

3. \(f\) is <b>bijective</b> if it is <i>surjective</i> and <i>injective</i> ( one-to-one and onto ).

A function is not complete unless we specify its domain, codoamin, range and rule: <br>

<b>Relation:</b> Set of ordered pairs.<br>
<b>Domain:</b> Set \(A\) on which \(f\) is defined. It represents the set of inputs or first elements and is called the preimage.<br>
<b>Codomain:</b> Set \(B\) in which \(f\) takes its values. It represents the set of possible outputs or second elements.<br>
<b>Range:</b> While the codomain is the set of possible outcomes, the range is the set of actual outcomes, and is called the image.<br>
