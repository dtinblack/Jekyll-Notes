<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigroup">Semigroup</b></a>
<br><br>

A semigroup is a set \(S\) together with a binary operation "\( \bullet \)" ( that is a function \( \bullet : S \times S \rightarrow S \))
that satisfies the following axiom:

<br><br>
<i>Associativity:</i> For all \(a,b,c \in S \), the equation \( ( a \bullet b ) \bullet c = a \bullet ( b \bullet c ) \) holds.
<br><br>

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid">Monoid</a></b>
<br><br>

A monoid is a set \(S\) with a binary operation "\( \bullet \)" i.e. \( \bullet : S \times S \rightarrow S \) with the following axioms:

<br><br>
<i>Associativity:</i> For all \(a,b,c \in S \), the equation \( ( a \bullet b ) \bullet c = a \bullet ( b \bullet c ) \) holds.
<br><br>

<i>Identity Element:</i> there exists an element \(e\) in \(S\) such that for \(a \in S \),
the equalities \( e \bullet a = a \) and \( a \bullet e = a \) holds.

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">Group</a></b><br><br>

A group is a set \(G\) with a binary operation "\( \bullet \)" i.e. \( \bullet : G \times G \rightarrow G \) with the following axioms:

<br><br>
<i>Associativity:</i> For all \(a,b,c \in G \), the equation \( ( a \bullet b ) \bullet c = a \bullet ( b \bullet c ) \) holds.
<br><br>

<i>Identity Element:</i> there exists an element \(e\) in \(G\) such that for \(a \in G \),
the equalities \( e \bullet a = a \) and \( a \bullet e = a \) holds.
<br><br>
<i>Inverse:</i> For each \( a \in G\), there exists an element \( b \in G \) such that \(a \bullet b = e \) and \( b \bullet e = a \) where \(e \) is the identity element.
For each \(a\), the element \(b\) is unigue; it is the inverse of \(a\) and is typically denoted by \( a^{-1} \).

<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)">Ring</a></b><br><br>

A ring is a set \(R\) with two binary operations: \( \bullet \) and \( + \) ( commonly interpreted as addition and multiplication ) that satisfy the following axioms:
<br><br>
<i>Additive associativity:</i> For all \(a,b,c \in S \), then \( (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\),
