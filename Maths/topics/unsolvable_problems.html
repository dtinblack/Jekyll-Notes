<p>

In Alan Turing's article:
<a href="https://www.ivanociardelli.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Solvable-and-unsolvable-problems.pdf">Solvable and Unsolvable Problems</a>
he developes an argument to show that that certain types of problem are unsolvable.
<br>
<br> { need to add in more detail of the substitution puzzle }
The <b>Theorem</b> to be proven is: <i>There is no systematic proceedure by which one can tell whether a puzzle
is solvable.</i>
<br>
<br>
Turing will uses proof by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">Reducto Absurbum</i></a> which attempts to establish a claim showing that the
opposite scenario would lead to an absurity or contradiction.
<br>
<br>
Let \(P(R,S)\) be the puzzle whose rules are described by the row of sympbols \(R\) and whose
starting position is described by \(S\).
<br><br>
(i) There is no reason why we can not let the rules be the starting position \(P(R,R)\).
<br><br>
(ii) The moves ( or rules ) are unambiquous.
<br><br>
(iii) A puzzle 'comes out' if it reaches the position \(B\) or \(W\).
</p>
<p>
The rules of the puzzle can be classified into the following two classes:
<br>
<br>
Class I: is to consist of sets rules \(R\), which represent puzzles with unambiquous
moves such that \(P(R,R)\) comes out as \(W\).
<br><br>
Class II: contains all of the other cases.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
<br><br>
Assume that we have a proceedure that is able to distinquish rules of Class I from Class II. The systematic proceddure fr distinquishing
between the two classes can be put in the form of a subsitition puzzle, \(K\) therefore \(P(K,R)\).
<br><br>
Since the proceedure always gives an answer then the puzzle \(P(K,R)\) always comes out. Assume that the puzzle \(K\) gives a result \(B\) for
rules of Class I, and \(W\) for rules of class II. In sumary the puzzle with rules \(K\) has the following
properties:
<br><br>
(i) \(K\) has unambiquous moves.
<br><br>
(ii) \(P(K,R)\) always comes out whatever \(R\).
<br><br>
(iii) If \(R\) is in class I, then \(P(K,R)\) has end result \(B\).
<br><br>
(iv) If \(R\) is in class II, then \(P(K,R)\) has end result \(W\).
</p>
<p>
If we ask which class \(K\) belongs too we find that the properties are inconsistent with the definitions
of the two classes. The puzzle \(P(K,K)\) is bound to come out, but thge properties of \(K\) tell us
that we must get end result \(B\)
if \(K\) is in class I and \(W\) if it is class II, where as the definitions of the classess tell us that the end results
must be the other way around.
