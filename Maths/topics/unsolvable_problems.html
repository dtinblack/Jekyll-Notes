<p>

In Alan Turing's article:
<a href="https://www.ivanociardelli.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Solvable-and-unsolvable-problems.pdf">Solvable and Unsolvable Problems</a>
he developes an argument to show that that certain types of problem are unsolvable.
<br>
<br>
The Theorem to be proven is: <i>The is no systematic proceedure by which one can tell whether a puzzle is solvable.</i>
<br>
<br>
Turing will use proof by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">Reducto Absurbum</i></a> which attempts to establish a claim showing that the
opposite scenario would lead to an absurity or contradiction.
<br>
<br>
Let \(P(R,S)\) be the puzzle whose rules are described by the row of sympbols \(R\) and whose starting position is described by \(S\).
