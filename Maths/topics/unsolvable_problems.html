<p>

In Alan Turing's article:
<a href="https://www.ivanociardelli.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Solvable-and-unsolvable-problems.pdf">Solvable and Unsolvable Problems</a>
he developes an argument to show that that certain types of problem are unsolvable.
<br>
<br>
The <b>Theorem</b> to be proven is: <i>There is no systematic proceedure by which one can tell whether a puzzle
is solvable.</i>
<br>
<br>
Turing will uses proof by <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">Reducto Absurbum</i></a> which attempts to establish a claim showing that the
opposite scenario would lead to an absurity or contradiction.
<br>
<br>
(i) Let \(P(R,S)\) be the puzzle whose rules are described by the row of sympbols \(R\) and whose
starting position is described by \(S\).
<br><br>
(ii) There is no reason why we cann't let the rules be the starting position i.e \(P(R,R)\).
<br><br>
(iii) The moves ( or rules ) are unambiquous.
<br><br>
(iv) A puzzle 'comes out' if it reaches th epositiobn \(B\) or \(W\).
</p>
<p>
The rules of the puzzle can be classified into the following two classes:
<br>
<br>
Class I: is to consist of sets rules \(R\), which represent puzzles whith unambiquous
moves and such that \(P(R,R)\) comes out as \(W\).
<br><br>
Class II: contains all of the other cases.
</p>
<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
<br><br>
Assume that we have a proceedure that is able to distinquish rules of Class I from Class II. The systematic proceddure fr distinquishing
between the two classes can be put in the form of a subsitition puzzle, \(K\) therefore \(P(K,R)\).
<br><br>
Since the proceedure always gives an answer then the puzzle \(P(K,R)\) always comes out. Assume that the puzzle \(K\) gives a result \(B\) for
rules of Class I, and \(W\) for rules of class II. In sumary the puzzle with rules \(K\) has the following
properties:
<br><br>
(i) \(K\) has unambiquous moves.
<br><br>
(ii) \(P(K,R)\) always comes out whatever \(R\).
<br><br>
(iii) If \(R\) is in class I, then \(P(K,R)\) hs end result \(B\).
<br><br>
(iv) If \(R\) is in class II, then \(P(K,R)\) hs end result \(W\).
</p>
<p>
If we ask which class \(K\) belongs to we find that the properties are inconsistent with the definitions
of the two classes.
