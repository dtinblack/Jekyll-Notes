<p>Some definitions:</p>

<p>A <b>quadrilateral</b> is a plane figure bounded by <i>four</i> straight lines.<p>

<p>A <b>square</b> is a four-sided fiqure which has all its sides equal and all of its angles are right angles.</p>

<p>An <b>oblong</b> is a four sided fiqure which has all of its angles right angles, but not all of its sides equal.</p>


<p>Let<br><br>
\(P\) = "the shape is a square" and <br>
\(Q\) = "the shape has four sides of equal length"
</p>

<h1>Sufficient Conditions</h1>

<br>
<p>Using the following Truth Table:</p>
<br>

\(
% line space
\)
<br>
<center>
<p>
\(
\begin{array}{|c c|c| c }
% |c c|c| means that there are three columns in the table and
% a vertical bar ’|’ will be printed on the left and right borders,
% and between the second and the third columns.
% The letter ’c’ means the value will be centered within the column,
% letter ’l’, left-aligned, and ’r’, right-aligned.
P & Q & P \implies Q\\  % Use & to separate the columns
\hline % Put a horizontal line between the table header and the rest.
T & T & T & ( i )\\
T & F & F & ( ii )\\
F & T & T & ( iii )\\
F & F & T & ( iv )\\
\end{array}
\)
</p>
</center>

<br>

<p><b>Case (i): If</b> <i>the shape is a square</i><b>, then</b> <i>the shape has four sides of equal length</i>.
<br>
<br>The statement is True.</p>

<p><b>Case (ii): If </b> <i>the shape is a square</i><b>, then <i></b>the shape doesn't have four sides of equal length.</i>
<br>
<br>The statement is False.</p>

<p><b>Case (iii): If </b><i>the shape is not a square</i><b>, then </b><i>the shape has four sides of equal length</i>.
<br>
<br>The statement is True.</p>

<p><b>Case (iv): If </b><i>the shape is not a square</i><b>, then</b> <i>"the shape does not have four sides of equal length".
<br>
<br>The statement is False</p>

<p><br>
The condition of P being true is enough (i.e. sufficient ) to make Q true; hence "\(P\) is a sufficient condition for \(Q\)."
