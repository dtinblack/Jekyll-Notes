<p>To help discuss conditional statements lets describe a world of shapes:</p>

<p>A <b>quadrilateral</b> is a plane figure bounded by <i>four</i> straight lines.<p>

<p>A <b>square</b> is a four-sided shape which has all its sides equal and all its angles are right angles.</p>

<p>An <b>oblong</b> is a four sided fiqure which has all of its angles right angles, but not all of its sides equal.</p>

<p>A <b>rhombus</b> is a four-sided shape which has all its sides equal, but its angles are not right angles.

<p>Using the following statements ( a statement can either be true or false )<br><br>
\(P\) = "the shape is a square" and <br>
\(Q\) = "the shape has four sides of equal length"<br><br>

Note that \(Q\) should include "<b>and</b> its angles are right angles" but using a truth table it can be shown that nothing
is lost with a reduced statement.

<p><b>Sufficient Conditions - If, then</b></p>


<p>Using the following Truth Table:</p>
<br>

\(
% line space
\)
<br>
<center>
<p>
\(
\begin{array}{|c c|c| c }
% |c c|c| means that there are three columns in the table and
% a vertical bar ’|’ will be printed on the left and right borders,
% and between the second and the third columns.
% The letter ’c’ means the value will be centered within the column,
% letter ’l’, left-aligned, and ’r’, right-aligned.
P & Q & P \implies Q\\  % Use & to separate the columns
\hline % Put a horizontal line between the table header and the rest.
T & T & T & ( i )\\
T & F & F & ( ii )\\
F & T & T & ( iii )\\
F & F & T & ( iv )\\
\end{array}
\)
</p>
</center>

<br>

<p><b>Case (i): If</b> <i>the shape is a square</i><b>, then</b> <i>it has four sides of equal length.</i>.
<br>
<br>From the description of a square the statement is true.</p>

<p><b>Case (ii): If </b> <i>the shape is a square</i><b>, then <i></b>it doesn't have four sides of equal length.</i>
<br>
<br>From the description of a square the statement is false because must have four equal sides.

<p><b>Case (iii): If </b><i>the shape is not a square</i><b>, then </b><i>it has four sides of equal length.</i>.
<br>
<br>Although the shape may not be square it could still have four equal sides e.g. a rhombus, therefore the statement is true.</p>

<p><b>Case (iv): If </b><i>the shape is not a square</i><b>, then</b><i>it does not have four sides of equal length.</i>
<br>
<br>From the description of a square the statment is true.</p>

<p><br>
The condition of P being true is enough ( i.e. sufficient ) to make Q true; hence "\(P\) is a sufficient condition for \(Q\)." In the world of shapes then being a
square is a sufficent condition for it to have four sides.

<p><b>Necessary Conditions - only if</b></p>

<p>Using the following Truth Table:</p>
<br>

\(
% line space
\)
<br>
<center>
<p>
\(
\begin{array}{|c c|c| c }
% |c c|c| means that there are three columns in the table and
% a vertical bar ’|’ will be printed on the left and right borders,
% and between the second and the third columns.
% The letter ’c’ means the value will be centered within the column,
% letter ’l’, left-aligned, and ’r’, right-aligned.
P & Q & Q \implies P\\  % Use & to separate the columns
\hline % Put a horizontal line between the table header and the rest.
T & T & T & ( i )\\
T & F & T & ( ii )\\
F & T & F & ( iii )\\
F & F & T & ( iv )\\
\end{array}
\)
</p>
</center>

<br>

<p><b>Case (i): If</b> <i>the shape has four sides</i><b>, then</b> <i>the shape is a square</i>.
<br>
<br>From the definiion of a square the statement is True.</p>

<p><b>Case (ii): If </b> <i>the shape has four sides</i><b>, then <i></b>the shape isn't a square.</i>
<br>
<br>Although the shape has four sides it doesn't have to be a square, for example a rhombus, therefore the statement is true.
</p>

<p><b>Case (iii): If </b><i>the shape doesn't have four sides</i><b>, then </b><i>the shape has four sides of equal length</i>.
<br>
<br>From the definition of a square the statement is false. </p>

<p><b>Case (iv): If </b><i>the shape does not have four sides of equal length</i><b>, then</b> <i>the shape is not a square</i>
<br>
<br>From the defintion of a square then the statement is true.</p>

<p><br>

Note that the statement \(P \implies Q\) being true means that it is impossible that \(P\) is
true but \(Q\) is false, so in order for \(P\) to be true it is necessary that \(Q\) is true;
hence "<i>\(Q\) is a necessry condition for \(P\).</i>" And this means that \(P\) can only
be true if \(Q\) is true i.e., <i>"\(P\) only if \(Q\)"</i> for the example, to have four sides is
a necessary condition for the shape to be a square.
