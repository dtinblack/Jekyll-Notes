---

The following is a road map for the mathematics that underly Alan Turing's paper: [On Computable Numbers](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf). Each section includes the general ideas to the concepts under discussion, and where appropriate mathematical proofs. Where mathematical proofs are discussed the underlying logical structures are shown.  
<br>
<br>
<b>A. $$ |\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{E}| $$</b>
<br>
<br>
Introduce the connection between [bijective functions](/topics/functions.html) and denumerability with an example. 
<br>
<br>
$$
\begin{array}{ c | c c c c c c }
n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & ... \\  % Use & to separate the columns
\hline % Put a horizontal line between the table header and the rest.
f(n) & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 & 10 & ... \\
\end{array}
$$
<br>
<br>
<b>B. $$ |\mathbb{N}| \ne |\mathbb{R}| $$</b>
<br>
<br>
Introduce diagonalisation argument and its application. Link to a proof that there is no injective function. Also, how to construct from the 'bits'. See 'Book of Proofs' section about Cantor's Diagonalisation argument.
<br>
<br>
<b>C. $$ |\mathcal{P}(S)| > |S| $$ </b>
<br>
<br>
Extend the ideas shown in section B.
<br>
<br>
<b>D. Cantor's Paradox</b>
<br>
<br>
Russell's problems with Cantor's work which leads to Cantor's Paradox.
<br>
<br>
<b>E. Russell's Paradox</b>
<br>
<br>
How Russell tried to overcome Cantor's Paradox but ended up with his own paradox.
<br>
<br>
<b>F. Generalisation of the Diagonalisation Argument</b>
<br>
<br>
How the diagonalisation argument can be extended to any properties which will be used later.
<br>
<br>
<b>G. Goedel's Proof</b>

[Goedel's Proof by Ernst Nagel and James R. Newman](https://calculemus.org/cafe-aleph/raclog-arch/nagel-newman.pdf) - see Richardson's Paradox ( where would it sit with Quine's classification of Paradoxes? ) and how it is used to describe the metalanguage idea.

<b>H. Turing's Undecidability ( or unsolvability )</b>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>?. Lambda Calculus and Turing's Undecidability ( or unsolvability )</b>
