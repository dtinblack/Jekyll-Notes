<p>
Starting from the Pigeonhole Principle and then working through the consequences of van der Waereden Theorem in proving that their is an infinte nuumber of primes.
The text will be used as an attachement to a post about the applicability of mathematics, in particular starting for a simple observation.

<p><b>Pigeon Hole Principle</b></p>
<p>
The Pigeonhole Principle states that if \(n\) items are put into \(m\) containers, with \( n > m \), then at least one container must contain more than one item.
