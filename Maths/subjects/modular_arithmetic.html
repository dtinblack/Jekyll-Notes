If a number \(a\) divides the difference of the numbers \(b\) and \(c\),
Congruent numbers, \(b\) and \(c\) are said to be <i>congruent relative</i> to \(a\); if not, b and c are
moduli, residues, and nonresidues noncongruent. The number \(a\) is called the <i>modulus</i>. If the numbers
b and c are congruent, each of them is called a residue of the other.
If they are noncongruent they are called nonresidues.

<div class="tab">
<p>

The numbers involved must be positive or negative integers,a not
fractions. For example, - 9 and + 16 are congruent relative to 5;
-7 is a residue of +15 relative to 11, but a nonresidue relative to 3.

Since every number divides zero, it follows that we can regard
any number as congruent to itself relative to any modulus.

<p>
Congruence is an equivalence relation, if a and b are congruent modulo n, then
they have no difference in modular arithmetic under modulo n. Represented by \(a \equiv b \; (\bmod\; n)\).
Other representations are: <br><br>
\( a = b + nk \) where \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \),<br><br>
and<br><br>
\(n \textbf{|} ( a - b )\).<br><br>

Example: <br><br>

\(7 \equiv 4 \; (\bmod\; 3 )\), can be represented as:<br><br>

\(3 | ( 7 - 4 )\), or<br><br>

\( 7 = 4 + 3n \) where \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).
