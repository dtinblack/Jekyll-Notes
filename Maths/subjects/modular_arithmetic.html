\(\blacktriangleright\)1. If a number \(a\) divides the difference of the numbers \(b\) and \(c\),
Congruent numbers, \(b\) and \(c\) are said to be <i>congruent relative</i> to \(a\); if not, b and c are
moduli, residues, and nonresidues noncongruent. The number \(a\) is called the <i>modulus</i>. If the numbers
b and c are congruent, each of them is called a residue of the other.
If they are noncongruent they are called nonresidues.

The numbers involved must be positive or negative integers,a not
fractions. For example, - 9 and + 16 are congruent relative to 5;
-7 is a residue of +15 relative to 11, but a nonresidue relative to 3.

     Since every number divides zero, it follows that we can regard
     any number as congruent to itself relative to any modulus.

  .._ 2. Given a, all its residues modulo m are contained in the
  formula a+ km where k is an arbitrary integer. The easier prop-
  ositions that we state below follow at once from this, but with
  equal ease they can be proved directly.
  Henceforth we shall designate congruence by the symbol ==,
  joining to it in parentheses the modulus when it is necessary to
  d o s o ; e . g . - 7 = 1 5 ( m o d . 1 1 ) , - 1 6 == 9 ( m o d . S ) . b

3. THEOREM. Let m successive integers a, a + 1, a + 2, ... a + m - 1 and another integer A be given; then one, and only one, of these integers will be congruent to A relative to m.
  If(a- A)/misanintegerthena==A;ifitisafraction,letk be the next larger integer (or if it is negative, the next smaller integer not regarding sign). A + km wilt fall between a and a + m and will be the desired number. Evidently all the quotients
  (a - A)/m, (a +1- A)/m, (a +2- A)/m, etc. lie between k - 1
  and k + 1, so only one of them can be an integer.

<p>
Congruence is an equivalence relation, if a and b are congruent modulo n, then
they have no difference in modular arithmetic under modulo n. Represented by \(a \equiv b \; (\bmod\; n)\).
Other representations are: <br><br>
\( a = b + nk \) where \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \),<br><br>
and<br><br>
\(n \textbf{|} ( a - b )\).<br><br>

Example: <br><br>

\(7 \equiv 4 \; (\bmod\; 3 )\), can be represented as:<br><br>

\(3 | ( 7 - 4 )\), or<br><br>

\( 7 = 4 + 3n \) where \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).
