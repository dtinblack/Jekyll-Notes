The Group Structure of the Integers<br><br>

A group is a set \(G\) with a binary operation "\( \bullet \)" i.e. \( \bullet : G \times G \rightarrow G \) with the following axioms:

<br><br>
<i>Associativity:</i> For all \(a,b,c \in G \), the equation \( ( a \bullet b ) \bullet c = a \bullet ( b \bullet c ) \) holds.
<br><br>

<i>Identity Element:</i> there exists an element \(e\) in \(G\) such that for \(a \in G \),
the equalities \( e \bullet a = a \) and \( a \bullet e = a \) holds.
<br><br>
<i>Inverse:</i> For each \( a \in G\), there exists an element \( b \in G \) such that \(a \bullet b = e \) and \( b \bullet e = a \) where \(e \) is the identity element.
For each \(a\), the element \(b\) is unigue; it is the inverse of \(a\) and is typically denoted by \( a^{-1} \).

Let \( \mathbb{Z} = \{ -\infty \dots -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \dots \infty \}\)<br><br>
