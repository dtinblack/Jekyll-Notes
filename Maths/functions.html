<p>
A function, \(f\), from set \(A\) to set \(B\), is a rule that assigns each element of  \(A\) to exactly one element
of  \(B\), and we write \(f ( a ) = b \) and say that \(f\) maps \(a\) to \(b\). To indicate
that \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\) we write: \(f: A \rightarrow B \).

<p>
A function is not complete unless we specify its domain, codoamin, range and rule: <br>

<b>Relation:</b> Set of ordered pairs.<br>
<b>Domain:</b> Set \(A\) on which \(f\) is defined. It represents the set of inputs or first elements and is called the preimage.<br>
<b>Codomain:</b> Set \(B\) in which \(f\) takes its values. It represents the set of possible outputs or second elements.<br>
<b>Range:</b> While the codomain is the set of possible outcomes, the range is the set of actual outcomes, and is called the image.<br>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>
   <b>Definition 3.1 Function</b>. A <i>function</i> \(f(x): A \rightarrow B \) is a mapping of each element of \(A\) to an element of \(B\).

<b>Injective</b><br><br>

<div class="boxed">
  <p>
   <b>Definition 3.1 Injective Function</b>. An <i>injective</i> function\(f\) is said to be
   <b>one-to-one</b>, if and only if \(f(a) = f(b)\) suchh that \(a = b \) for all \(a\) and
   \(b\) in the domain in \(f\).
   <br>
   <br>
    In other words for a function to be one-to-one every disctinct element in A has a distinct image in B.
