# Jekyll-Tutorial: Hello World

A stripped back version of Jekyll so that it only runs the default page.


### Folders

_site - where the website generated by Jekyll is placed. It is a good place to check that the folders and files that have been generated are what was expected.

### Files

index.html - html page is the most common name used for the default page shown on a website.

Gemfile - used to generate the Gemfile.lock

.gitignore - files excluded from Github. In this case the folder _site is excluded.
