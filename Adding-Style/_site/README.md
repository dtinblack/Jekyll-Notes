# Jekyll-Tutorial: Hello World

A stripped back version of Jekyll which runs the default page.


### Folders

_site - where the website generated by Jekyll is placed. It is a good place to check that the folders and files that have been generated are what was expected.

### Files

favicon.ico - [image](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp) displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab.

index.html - default page shown on a website.

Gemfile - used by [Bundle](https://bundler.io/gemfile.html) to generate the Gemfile.lock file. 

Gemfile.lock - contains all of the [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/) used by Jekyll.

.gitignore - files excluded from Github. In this case the folder _site is excluded.
