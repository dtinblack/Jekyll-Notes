# Jekyll-Tutorial: Style

Jekyll comes bundled with [jekyll-sass-converter plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter). By default, Jekyll will look for Sass [Partials](https://www.w3schools.com/sass/sass_import.php) in the _sass directory relative to your siteâ€™s source directory.

### Folders

_sass - Two Partials for the background and colours.

### Files

style.scss - example of modifying the style of a html file using Sass and Partials. The file is processed from a Sass type file into a css file which is placed in the _site folder.
