# Jekyll-Notes

The following notes were gathered while I was learning about Jekyll. The notes cover the use of use of [Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) or developing my own. The notes take a [bottom-up approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) in learning about Jekyll's [Tech Stack](https://heap.io/topics/what-is-a-tech-stack).

[Jekyll's](https://jekyllrb.com/) website contains a wealth of information including its Github repository where the code for it can be explored. Further information about installing Jekyll can be found [here](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/jekyll-tutorial/)

The notes are broken down into the following sections:

[Hello-World](https://github.com/dtinblack/Jekyll-Notes/tree/main/Hello-World) - a minimum version of Jekyll running a default page.  

[Style](https://github.com/dtinblack/Jekyll-Notes/tree/main/Style) - adding style sheets to the web site.

[Liquid](https://github.com/dtinblack/Jekyll-Notes/tree/main/Liquid)

[Plugins](https://github.com/dtinblack/Jekyll-Notes/tree/main/Plugins)
