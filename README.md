# Jekyll-Notes

The following notes were developed while I was learning about Jekyll. They take a [bottom-up approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_and_bottom-up_design) in understanding  Jekyll's [Tech Stack](https://heap.io/topics/what-is-a-tech-stack) and how it works.

[Jekyll's](https://jekyllrb.com/) website contains a wealth of information including its Github repository.

[Hello-World](https://github.com/dtinblack/Jekyll-Notes/tree/main/Hello-World) - a minimum version of Jekyll running a default page.
